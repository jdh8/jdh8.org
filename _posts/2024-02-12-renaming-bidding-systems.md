I've been with my girlfriend for 2+ months and finally found the red and blue
mascots for my bridge bidding systems.

- [Litten](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Litten_(Pok%C3%A9mon)) for
  [Litten Polish Club](https://jdh8.github.io/bridge-systems/wj.htm)
- [Oshawott](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Oshawott_(Pok%C3%A9mon))
  for [Mijumaru Blue Club](https://jdh8.github.io/bridge-systems/blue.htm)

Oshawott is my girlfriend's favorite pokémon.  She thinks that Litten is my
pokémon since my fursona is an orange cat.  These two pokémons fit the color
stickers from [WBF systems policy][wbf] and also the [Red Oni, Blue Oni][oni]
trope.

By the way, recently I reached 1800+ Elo on [Cuebids][cuebids].  I took a
screenshot because I not only was proud of it but also thought it cannot last
long.
