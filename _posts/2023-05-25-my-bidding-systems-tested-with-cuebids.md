I tested my bidding systems on [Cuebids][cuebids], a web app for pairs to
practice bidding.  All three accounts using my bidding systems made it to the
top 10 this week.  The following is the screenshot of the top 10 list when
[Mijumaru Blue Club][blue] (known as Bluepill (Canap√©) Club then) just entered
the list.  My own account and Irene playing only [Litten Polish Club][red] were
the top two.

[cuebids]: https://cuebids.com/
[blue]: https://jdh8.github.io/bridge-systems/blue.htm
[red]: https://jdh8.github.io/bridge-systems/wj.htm

We are still on top 5 as of this writing.  We will try to stay on top 10 but
not to be top 3 at the same time to keep the environment competitive.

[My collection of bidding systems][collection] is available on GitHub.  It
contains aforementioned systems and [a defensive system][defense].  Litten
Polish Club is almost complete.  Mijumaru Blue Club is still evolving.  The
defensive system is still in its infancy.
