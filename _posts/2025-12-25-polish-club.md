I just moved Strawberry Polish Club to [polish.club](https://polish.club/).
One site for one bidding system feels cleaner than a site for multiple systems.
My other bidding systems are also on their own sites:

- [Blueberry Precision Club](https://jdh8.github.io/blueberry-precision/)
- [Watermelon Dutch Doubleton](https://jdh8.github.io/watermelon-dutch/)
