Responder's direct cuebid is a disputed and under-discussed topic.
There are two popular usages of this bid:

* Limit raise or better
* Generic game force

I suggest different approaches to major and minor openings.

After a major opening
---------------------
The cuebid is a **limit raise or better**.  From the pigeonhole
principle, you have either of these:

* 3-card support
* 5-card unbid suit
* 4-4 unbid suits
* 4-card adverse suit

The promise of a fit clears the way for finding a game.  Other calls
better describe game-forcing hands without 3-card support.

* 5-card unbid suit: free bid
* 4-4 unbid: negative double
* 4-card adverse suit: 3NT

After a minor opening
---------------------
We make the cuebid a versatile tool to **combine** the advantages of
popular treatments.

According to the previous section, you can have an embarrassing strong
hand with no 4-card support, no biddable side suit, and no stopper in
the adverse suit.  Imagine holding the following hand at 1♣-(1♠)-?

♠ xxx  
♥ Axx  
♦ Axxx  
♣ Axx

You could have bid 3NT if RHO did not overcall, but you cannot now because
there is no spade stopper.  You are wary of passing because 3NT is still
playable if your partner has a spade stopper.  Ask for one with 2♠.

Besides, we can keep the limit raise.  Your partner is eager to show a
stopper as notrump games score more than minor games.  Including the
limit raise in the cuebid does not affect the bidding structure.
