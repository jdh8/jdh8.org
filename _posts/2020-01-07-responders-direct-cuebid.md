What responder's direct cuebid means is a disputed yet underdiscussed topic.
There are two popular usage of this bid:

* Limit raise or better
* Generic game force

I suggest a combination of these, i.e. limit raise or better __or__ generic
game force.  However, 3+-card support is still promised after a major opening.

After a major opening
---------------------
With game-forcing values, you will have either of these:
* 3+-card support
* 5+-card unbid suit: free bid
* 4-4 in unbid suits: negative double
* 4+-card adverse suit: 3NT

As hands without 3-card support can be better described by other calls, it is
safe to assume that the direct cuebid promises 3+-card support, no matter of
strength.
