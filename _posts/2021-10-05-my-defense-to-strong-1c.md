title: My defense to strong 1♣

My favorite defense to strong 1♣ is [Psycho Suction][psycho].  I filled in 2NT
and the 1-level as per the [useful space principle][usp].  This defense is so
flexible that it also applies to strong 1♦ and over the forced responder, e.g.
1♣-1♦-(?).

| X   | Takeout double or stolen bid
| 1x  | Natural or lead-directing
| 1NT | Non-touching pairs (♠ ♦ or ♥ ♣)
| 2♣  | Clubs or red suits
| 2♦  | Diamonds or majors
| 2♥  | Hearts or black suits
| 2♠  | Spades or minors (supplement to 2NT)
| 2NT | Minors
{:.convention}

Psycho Suction is an extension to the natural defense.  It is a superset of the
weak twos.  The two suiters increase the probabilities of the 2-bids and
unanchor them.  Psycho Suction establishes a pass-or-correct system where the
2x overcalls are also pass-or-correct.  The word "psycho" reflects the risk of
playing an undoubled misfit like psychic bids.

Paradox advances
================
[The paradox principle][paradox] in a pass-or-correct system is to bypass
underbids.  For example, hearing 1♣-(2♦)-pass, we hold

♠ J98  
♥ KJ1032  
♦ Q98  
♣ Q2

| Option   | Advance |
|----------|---------|
| Diamonds | 3♦      |
| Majors   | 4♥      |

Bid 3♦.  Besides diamond support, this bid also shows that we can also raise
either major.  Underbidding 2♥ conveys too little information and takes away
too little space.

The paradox lies in that we do not bid our favorite strain.  We have to make
the cheapest call of the conjectured advances.  Resultantly, we usually bid for
the worst case.

Comparison with defenses to 1NT
===============================
### Similarities
The most common subtype of strong 1♣ is a strong notrump.  The opener is so
strong that we are unlikely to have a game, so our main goal is to compete with
partscores.  Our cuebid strain is notrump because opponents have shown strength
but no suit.

A common way to devise a defense to 1♣ is using our defense to 1NT.  Suction is
originally a defense to 1NT.  Such a defense to 1NT with no anchor suit is
banned in the [ACBL Basic+ chart][acblcc].[^basic-plus]  However, artificial
defenses to an artifical opening are generally allowed.[^fert]  Therefore, we
can derive a defense to 1♣ from such an exotic defense to 1NT.

[acblcc]: https://web2.acbl.org/documentLibrary/about/Convention-Charts.pdf
[^basic-plus]: Overcalls higher than 2♣ must be anchored except that 2♦ can be Multi.
[^fert]: Except fert bids, described as *purely destructive* in the [ACBL convention charts][acblcc].

### Differences
An obvious difference is that we can access 1-level overcalls.  Beware of the
lowest 2 overcalls as they give out bidding space.

| X   | Gives 2 steps (P, XX)
| 1♦  | Gives 1 step (P)
| 1♥  | Neither gives nor takes
| 1♠  | Takes 1 step
| 1NT | Takes 2 steps
{:.convention}

X and 1♦ are better constructive to make bidding space useful to everyone.
Natural 1♥ and 1♠ are fine.  Try to increase the probability of 2-level
overcalls, which take considerable space.

Another difference is that 1NT is limited and descriptive.  The opener does not
have much to say even if given a second chance to bid.  The probability that
the opener has a major is also lower.  These reasons make major-oriented
overcalls effective, e.g. [Multi-Landy][multi-landy].

On the other hand, a strong artificial opening is usually unlimited.  Forcing
overcalls are less effective since they let the opener pass at ease.  Thus, a
natural defense to 1♣ is stronger than to 1NT.  Besides, Inverted Psycho
Suction may work for 1NT, but Psycho Suction works better for 1♣.

Discussions
===========
### 5=4 two suiters
I include some 5=4 two suiters to increase the probabilities of Psycho Suction
bids.  The rest can be easily expressed with a simple major overcall, where the
4-card suit is lower than the 5-card major.

| 1♥  | 5+ hearts
| 1♠  | 5+ spades
| 1NT | 4+ spades 5+ diamonds or 4+ hearts 5+ clubs
| 2♣  | 6+ clubs or 4+ hearts 5+ diamonds
| 2♦  | 6+ diamonds or 4+ spades 5+ hearts
| 2♥  | 6+ hearts or 4+ spades 5+ clubs
| 2♠  | 6+ spades or 5+ diamonds 4+ clubs
| 2NT | 4+ diamonds 5+ clubs
{:.convention}

I believe 5=4 is the sweet spot of two suiters.  The original 5-5 is too
infrequent to make these overcalls different from weak twos.  The 5-4 pattern
is as frequent as the single-suited, putting the pass at higher risk.  Moreover,
5-4 bids are better guided with an extra step showing equal preference.  For
example, [Landy][landy] shows 5-4 in majors, and the 2♦ advance indicates equal
preference.  Nevertheless, this additional step bears a suit we deny, so it
lets opponents come in cheaply.

### Strength of X and 1♦
The strength to double is opening values.  The double is a two-way call that is
either a takeout double or a stolen opening bid with 5+ cards.

The 1♦ overcall is slightly stronger than 1♥ and 1♠ because it gives space yet
exhibits no major.  I suggest near average strength, i.e. 10+ total points in
which there are 8+ HCP.  I even recommend this approach to natural 1♣ since 1♦
leaks information without taking space.

### Overcalls with 16+ HCP
Congratulations on holding yet another strong club!  A comeback after passing
the first round definitely reveals 16+ HCP.  There are also situations where an
initial double is better.  To decide the best overcall, we have to investigate
their pros and cons.

The pass is better when coming back is easy.  The following qualities suggest a
pass.

- Single suiter
- 5-card major
- Balanced

The takeout double is made for three suiters.  It lets our partner decide the
strain.  If our partner bids our shortness, we can bid 1NT to provide choices
again.

Two suiters fall between these scenarios.  First, try to bid 1NT and 2NT since
they are forcing.  Next, hide a 4-card minor with a pass because introducing
the longest suit is often enough.  Then, we are left with the following two
suiters to double.

- Majors
- 4=5 or more in same-colored suits

When a fit is not found yet, we can easily run to the cheaper suit.  This
strategy happens to spare 2♣, our rebid to show a regular opener with clubs.

| Advance | Majors | Black | Red |
|:-------:|:------:|:-----:|:---:|
| **1♦**  |   1♥   |  1♠   |     |
| **1♥**  |        |  1♠   |     |
| **1♠**  |        |       | 2♦  |
