An o'ish relay is a forcing bid that is natural or has extra strength.  Famous
examples are Birthright (Kokish Relay, 2♣-2♦-2♥) and Polish Club (1♣), after
which I name this treatment.  I advocate playing a **transfer o'ish relay**
instead, the relay that either transfers to the next suit or has extra
strength.  This method renders the negative response nonforcing and allows
more descriptive rebids.

## Basic structure

- <abbr title="Transfer O&rsquo;ish Relay">TOR</abbr> = transfer or extra
  - (R) = NF negative, accepts the transfer
- TOR + 1 = transfer back to the suit of TOR

## Examples

### Birthright (Kokish Relay)

A classical problem with the strong 2♣ opening is whether the auction is
game-forcing.  One solution is the Kokish Relay, where opener bids 2♥ to show
hearts or a unilaterally game-forcing hand.  This treatment potentially wastes
space because opener hardly passes 2♥-2♠.

The rebids after 2♣-2♦ I propose are:

2♥
: 5+ spades or FG

2♠
: NF, 5+ hearts

2NT to 3♦
: NAT NF

After 2♥, the default 2♠ fits any hand that responder would pass natural 2♠.
Other responses are game-forcing.

After 2♠, responder passes with weak long spades.  The 3♥ response is to play.
Whether 2NT is game-forcing is up to partnership agreement.

### Polish Club with swapped minor suits

1♣
: Polish Club with diamonds instead of clubs:
1. Balanced 12--14 HCP
2. 11--17 HCP, 5+ diamonds or 4441
3. 18+ HCP, any

1♦
: 11--17 HCP, 5+ clubs or (441)4

It took me almost one year to accept this idea until I realized that 1♣-1X-2♣
should retransfer to diamonds.  The strength difference between natural
diamonds (11+ HCP) and clubs (18+ HCP) is so large that opener should transfer
twice.  The *odwrotka* sequence of 1♣-1X-2♦ remains a power reverse.

## Drawbacks

Responding to TOR + 1 is more complicated than TOR.  You can no longer park at
the negative relay (TOR + 1). Accepting the transfer (TOR + 5) becomes default
and often meets a pass.  Take 1♦ (showing clubs) for example:

- Pass: weak long diamonds
- 1NT: constructive natural, effectively 4+ diamonds
- 2♣: almost a signoff with 3--4 clubs
- 2♥♠: game try with 3+ clubs
- 2NT: preemptive raise with 4+ clubs
- 3♣: mixed raise with 4+ clubs
