I have been researching on [Wbridge5][wbr5], a prominent bridge program.
I used to be confused that it disables [inverted minors][invm] by
default.  Recently I came up with a conclusion.

> Wbridge5 opens **strong notrump** by default, so this treatment is
> disabled.  Wbridge5 still includes inverted minors because *weak
> notrump* is a choice.

Inverted minors originated from [Kaplan--Sheinwold][ks].  It is
popular in East and Southeast Asia because of [Precision
Club][prec], a bidding system based on K-S with the [strong club][club]
that inherits the weak notrump opening.

Nowadays, many players open strong notrump according to [*something
American*][am].  However, some of them still employ inverted minors.  It
has pros easily found by searching "[inverted minors][duck]."  Hence, I
list its cons as a balance report.

*Garbage* 1NT response
----------------------
The weakness of inverted minors is not on itself but the 1NT response
adjusted by the inverted minors.  The 1NT response shows either of the
following:

Constructive 1NT
: Expected 6+ tricks if both minimum.

*Garbage* 1NT
: Expected only 5 tricks if both minimum.

When the partner opens 1♠, 1<span class="redsuit">♥</span>, or
1<span class="redsuit">♦</span>, not to miss a probable game, the
garbage 1NT is *on*.  <small>Overcalls invalidate inverted minors, so
their counteractions fall out of the topic.</small>

_Without_ inverted minors, a 1NT response to 1♣ is always constructive.
Respond 2♣ with a weak 3-3-3-4 because the opener often has 4+ clubs.

If 1♣ ensures 3+ clubs
: With minimum strength, the probability of mere 3 clubs is 21.5%.

If 1♣ can be 4-4-3-2
: With minimum strength, the probability of mere 3 clubs is 20.4%, 4-4-3-2 5.19%.

### Weak 4-card support dumped as garbage ###
Express 5-card support as 3 level preempts.  Nevertheless, 1NT with weak
4-card support is much less preemptive.  Is there so much difference
between 2 of a minor and 1NT, as 1NT is just one or two bids lower?
Let's consider the following.

|   W   |  N  |     E     |  S  |
|-------|-----|-----------|-----|
|       | 1♣  |     -     | 1NT |
| X[^1] |  -  | **-**[^2] |  ?  |

[^1]: [Takeout double](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeout_double)
[^2]: Convert to business double

The point is not whether to escape, but the positive pass.  Notrump is
awful for the declarer, with 6.06 tricks taken on average.
1NTxS&minus;3 is more tragic than 3NTE= without favorable vulnerability.
Besides, the total notrump tricks may be less than 13.

If we responded 2♣ instead, east must have clubs to pass, and the lowest
positive advance becomes 2NT.  *Preemption is force opponents to bid
strong hands high.* Although 2♣ is only one bid higher than 1NT, it
pushes pass and cuebid onto 2NT.
