My favorite defense to strong 1♣ is [Psycho Suction][psycho].  I filled in 2NT
and the 1-level as per the [useful space principle][usp].  This defense is so
flexible that it also applies to strong 1♦ and over the forced responder, e.g.
1♣-1♦-(?).

| X   | Takeout double or stolen bid
| 1x  | Natural or lead-directing
| 1NT | Non-touching pairs (♠ ♦ or ♥ ♣)
| 2♣  | Clubs or red suits
| 2♦  | Diamonds or majors
| 2♥  | Hearts or black suits
| 2♠  | Spades or minors (supplement to 2NT)
| 2NT | Minors

Psycho Suction is an extension to the natural defense.  It is a superset of the
weak 2s.  The two-suiters increase the probabilities of the 2-bids and unanchor
them.  Psycho Suction establishes a pass-or-correct system where the 2x
overcalls are also pass-or-correct.  The word "psycho" reflects the risk of
playing an undoubled misfit like psychic bids.

Paradox advances
================
[The paradox principle][paradox] is more than pass or correct.  It is to
consider what to respond to each option and make the cheapest call.  For
example, hearing 1♣-(2♦)-pass, we hold

♠ J98  
♥ KJ1032  
♦ Q98  
♣ Q2

| Option   | Advance |
|----------|---------|
| Diamonds | 3♦      |
| Majors   | 4♥      |

Bid 3♦.  Besides diamond support, this bid also shows that we can also raise
either major.  Underbidding 2♥ conveys too little information and takes away
too little space.

Comparison with defenses to 1NT
===============================
### Similarities
The most common subtype of strong 1♣ is a strong notrump.  The opener is so
strong that we are unlikely to have a game, so our main goal is to compete with
partscores.  Our cuebid strain is notrump because opponents have shown strength
but no suit.

A common way to devise a defense to 1♣ is using our defense to 1NT.  Suction is
originally a defense to 1NT.  Such a defense to 1NT with no anchor suit is
banned in the [ACBL Basic+ chart][acblcc].[^basic-plus]  However, artificial
defenses to an artifical opening are generally allowed.[^fert]  Therefore, we
can derive a defense to 1♣ from such an exotic defense to 1NT.

[acblcc]: https://web2.acbl.org/documentLibrary/about/Convention-Charts.pdf
[^basic-plus]: Overcalls higher than 2♣ must be anchored except that 2♦ can be Multi.
[^fert]: Except fert bids, described as *purely destructive* in the [ACBL convention charts][acblcc].

### Differences
An obvious difference is that we can access 1-level overcalls.  Beware of the
lowest 2 overcalls as they give out bidding space.

| X   | Gives 2 steps (P, XX)
| 1♦  | Gives 1 step (P)
| 1♥  | Neither gives nor takes
| 1♠  | Takes 1 step
| 1NT | Takes 2 steps
{:.convention}

X and 1♦ are better constructive to make bidding space useful to everyone.
Natural 1♥ and 1♠ are fine.  Try to increase the probability of 2-level
overcalls, which take considerable space.

Another difference is that 1NT is limited and descriptive.  The opener does not
have much to say even if given a second chance to bid.  The probability that
the opener has a major is also lower.  These reasons make major-oriented
overcalls effective, e.g. Multi-Landy.

On the other hand, a strong artificial opening is usually unlimited.  Forcing
overcalls are less effective because they let the opener pass at ease.  Thus, a
natural defense to 1♣ is stronger than to 1NT.  Besides, Inverted Psycho
Suction may work for 1NT, but Psycho Suction works better for 1♣.
