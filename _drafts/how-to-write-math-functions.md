title: How to write mathematical functions
---
It is achievable to write fast and precise mathematical functions.
There are cutting-edge implementations in computers, phones, calculators,
and game consoles.  Some of them are open source, like glibc and musl,
from which we can learn the state of the art.  I have also been working
on mathematics in [metallic][metallic], as a shameless plug.

Mathematical functions are usually written software instead of hardware
instructions.  The trend is to have the hardware deal with only basic
operations after decades of evolution.  The only popular architecture
with transcendental instructions is arguably x87.  Mathematical
functions are usually computed with only required operations in IEEE 754
and integer operations via type punning.

Target system
-------------
### Instruction set
Which instructions are on the target system?  C operators are probably
supported.  Other operations are less available even if they are
_required_ by IEEE 754.  For example, `fmod` rarely compiles to a single
instruction.  It is usually done by long division, which in turn
translates to a series of integer operations or partial remainder
instructions.  This is also an example where operators in other
programming languages can be more expensive than expected, like `%` in
JavaScript or Python.

### Programming language
It is recommended to implement mathematical functions in C.  Its
sparsity of sequence points allow long expressions to be evaluated in a
fast and precise way.  For instance, `a * b + c` can compile to a fused
multiplyâ€“add for supporting platforms.  On the other hand, explicitly
assign to an intermediate to force rounding.

```c
// Nearest integer for a nonnegative argument
float nearest(float x)
{
    const float rectifier = 0x1p23f;
    float y = x + rectifier;
    return y - rectifier;

    // Wrong: can be optimized to (x + 0)
    return x + rectifier - rectifier;
}
```
