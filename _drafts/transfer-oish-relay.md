An o'ish relay is a forcing bid that is natural or has extra strength.  Famous
examples are Birthright (Kokish Relay, 2♣-2♦-2♥) and Polish Club (1♣), after
which I name this treatment.  I advocate playing a **transfer o'ish relay**
instead, the relay that either transfers to the next suit or has extra
strength.  This method renders the negative response nonforcing and allows
more descriptive rebids.
